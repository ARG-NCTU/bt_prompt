The drone is engaged in an emergency search and rescue mission.
According to information from the ground rescue team, a missing person has been reported to be in the direction ahead and slightly to the left of the drone's current position.
The person may have signaled using a reflective object or a small beacon, but due to challenging terrain or obstructed visibility, the exact location and distance are unknown.
The drone should execute a zigzag search pattern resembling the shape of a lightning bolt.
During the search, it is crucial that the drone does not move straight forward or directly towards the left more than twice, ensuring a thorough sweep of the area to locate the missing person and assist the ground team's rescue operation.
